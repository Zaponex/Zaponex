## Hi there 👋

<!--
**Zaponex/Zaponex** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

🔭 I'm currently working on...
As a Research Associate and PhD student at the Institute for Production Systems at Leuphana University, I'm focused on exploring the potential of Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) in high-flexible production systems. My research aims to investigate how AMRs can be integrated into heterogeneous production systems, and which types of AMRs would be most suitable for these applications.

🌱 I'm currently learning...
I'm constantly expanding my knowledge in the areas of simulation, modeling, and implementation of production systems. I'm particularly interested in learning more about the integration of physical assets, digital twins, and hybrid communication in these systems.

👯 I'm looking to collaborate on...
I'm looking for opportunities to collaborate with researchers, developers, and industry professionals who share my interest in AMRs and production systems. If you're working on similar projects or have expertise in areas such as simulation, modeling, or robotic systems, I'd love to discuss potential collaborations.

💬 Ask me about...
Feel free to ask me about my research on AMRs in production systems, or about my experience with simulation tools like Simpy or three.js. I'm also happy to discuss potential collaborations or provide guidance on implementing AMRs in production environments.

📫 How to reach me...
You can reach me through my GitHub profile or by sending an email to ole.pruefer@leuphana.de
